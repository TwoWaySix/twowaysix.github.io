## Composer & Music Producer
Listening to and playing music has been an interest since my early childhood. 
I see myself as a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist with a focus on guitar, bass and drums.
Using Linux native tools (Bitwig Studio), I play, record and produce my music all by myself. 
My biggest inspirations are Radiohead, Polyphia and Lofi Hip Hop.

## Photographer
At around 2006 my interested in photography skyrocketed. 
My focus has always been portrait, street, landscape and cityscape photography - at best combined into one photo.
Traveling around the globe, I keep my eyes open for scenes that a worth the extra time to get the perfect shot.
