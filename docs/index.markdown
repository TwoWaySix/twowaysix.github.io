### :earth_africa: Preface 
As human beings, we have achieved a lot, 
but are still kinda blind towards our greatest challenge yet... even though it's lying right before our feet: *climate change*. 

***Does it really matter if it is man made or not after we've let it wipe us of the planet?***

Let's make the time we spend on our blue planet worthwhile. Not only for us, but for our children and their children.

## :computer: Software Developer

As an *environmental and civil engineer* by training :deciduous_tree:, the need to **process** and **visualize** huge amounts of data and **simulating** real world phenomena has always been my cup of tea.

My languages of choice:
* :snake: **Python**: visualizing, scripting, ML
* :mouse: **Go**: Backend development and CLI tools
* :crab: **Rust**: High performance code, simulations
* :coffee: **Java**: Big applications, necessity of a wide ecosystem
* :spider_web: **Typescript**: Web frontends

## :guitar: Composer & Music Producer

Listening to and playing music has been my biggest interest since my early childhood. I am a **multi-instrumentalist** and vocalist with a focus on guitar, bass and drums.

Using Linux native tools (***Bitwig Studio***), I **play, record** and **produce** my music all by myself.

My biggest inspirations are **Radiohead, Polyphia and John Frusciante**, 
but my influences come from a wide variety of genres (e.g. lofi hip hop, trap, progressive rock/metal, post/math/art-rock, grunge, ambient, shoegazing, video game music, metalcore, 90s hip hop, classical music).

## :cityscape: Photographer

At around 2006 my interested in photography skyrocketed. My focus has always been **portrait, street, landscape** and **cityscape** photography - at best combined into one photo.

Traveling around the globe, I keep my eyes open for scenes that are worth the extra time and effort to get a worthwhile memory.
