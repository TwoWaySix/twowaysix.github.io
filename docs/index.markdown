# Who am I?

* Software Developer
* Composer & Music Producer
* Photographer


## Software Developer

As an *environmental and civil engineer* by training, 
the need to **process** and **visualize** huge amounts of data 
and **simulating** real world phenomena has always been my cup of tea.

My languages of choice:
* **Python**: visualizing, scripting, ML
* **Rust**: High performance code, simulations, CLI tools
* **Java**: Big applications, necessity of a wide ecosystem
* **Typescript**: Web frontends


## Composer & Music Producer

Listening to and playing music has been my biggest interest since my early childhood. 
I am a **multi-instrumentalist** and vocalist with a focus on guitar, bass and drums.

Using Linux native tools (***Bitwig Studio***), I **play, record and produce** my music all by myself. 

My biggest inspirations are ***Radiohead, Polyphia and John Frusciante***, 
but my influences come from a wide variety of genres (e.g. lofi hip hop, trap, progressive rock/metal, post/math/art-rock, grunge, ambient, shoegazing, video game music, metalcore, 90s hip hop, classical music).

## Photographer

At around 2006 my interested in photography skyrocketed. 
My focus has always been **portrait, street, landscape** and **cityscape** photography - at best combined into one photo.

Traveling around the globe, I keep my eyes open for scenes that a worth the extra time to get the perfect shot.
